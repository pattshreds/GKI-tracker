## AAU
* I want to be able to input my gluclose and ketosis levels and have it return my GKI
    * formula: (Blood Glucose Result / 18) / Blood Ketone Result = GKI   
* I want to get informed of what my level means (i.e. in ketosis or not)
* track my results over time with a graph (D3)

## Tech Stack
* Reactjs
* Sass/Scss
* D3 for data visualization
* Eventually a database

## Few reminders for devs
* PLEASE WORK ON A NON-MAIN BRANCH TO AVOID MERGE CONFLICTS
    * I typically use my initials plus the word development (ZBDevelopment), so we can easily track whose sending what pull requests
* I'll attach a blank trello board so that we can easily track what still needs to get done
